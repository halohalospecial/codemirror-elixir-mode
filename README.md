codemirror-elixir-mode
======================

[Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org) mode for [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net) / [Light Table](http://www.lighttable.com) based on [ruby.js](https://github.com/marijnh/CodeMirror/blob/master/mode/ruby/ruby.js).

This is really a quick hack since CodeMirror does not have an official Elixir mode yet.

Syntax highlighting works most of the time, but auto-indentation needs improvement.
